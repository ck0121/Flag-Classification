dataset:
train set 70%
test set  15%
validation set  15%
further thinking: different shape of flag to train and classify (full wind, half wind, low wind)
 


blender: physical simulation
flag + HDRI + animation
further thinking: different strength of the wind

train algorithm
Pytorch and use Neural network
Pytorch and use Convolutional neural network (CNN)

new method: Detectron2

about Detectron,
youtube tutorial
register dataset: laballing
